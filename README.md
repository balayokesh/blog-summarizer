## ü§ñ How AI is Used

- The backend sends user blog content and summary length to the Cerebras (or Llama) LLM via API.
- The LLM returns a structured response with:
  - `tldr`: a concise summary
  - `bullets`: key points
  - `meta`: model info, tokens used, processing time
- The frontend displays the TL;DR by default, with an option to reveal bullet points.
